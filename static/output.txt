A.    BACKGROUND INFORMATION

       Road  and        Pole  Green  Road.  The  property     has  been  zoned  B-2  to  allow  for  banks,  clinics,
neighborhood retail uses, convenience stores, offices, professional buildings, restaurants, retail, hotels, repair
shops and certain other uses.

       At the time of Bond issuance, the developer had sold one 8.005-acre subdivided parcel to an
affiliated entity, The Shoppes at Bell Creek, for the development of a shopping center. The shopping center is
expected to include a 37,000 square foot Food Lion grocery store and 27,000 square feet of additional retail
space. The Shoppes at Bell Creek had entered into a lease with Food Lion for a term of twenty years and
approximately seven additional leases for terms ranging from three to five years, representing approximately
49,000 square feet of leased retail space (or 77 percent of total retail square footage available). The Shoppes at
Bell Creek had entered into a contract with Ashland Construction Company, Raleigh, North Carolina, to
construct the shopping center.

       As of December 31, 2013, the developer reports that there is a total of 6.896 acres of land available
for sale in the retail property section. According to the developer, the available retail property consists of
3.505 acres in Parcel A and 3.391 acres in Parcel B.

Other Commercial Property

       The 157-acre parcel for Bell Creek Industrial is located north the 20-acre retail property of Bell Creek
Commercial and extends to Verdi Lane. The property is zoned M-1 for light industrial uses such as banks,
offices, neighborhood retail, restaurants and retail as well as manufacturing, research, printing, warehousing
and certain other uses. The applicable zoning includes special conditions limiting operations to enclosed
buildings, setback and height limits, special parking requirements, front yard buffer requirements and building
material requirements. The dimensions of the property are such that a variety of lot sizes, ranging from 1 acre
to 30 acres, can be accommodated.

       At the time of Bond issuance, one 1.07-acre corner site within Bell Creek Industrial had been sold.
The buyer had expressed his intent to use the site for a veterinary clinic.

       As of December 31, 2013, the developer reports that there is a total of 71.542 acres of land available
for sale in the other commercial/light industrial parcels in the district. According to the developer, the
available commercial/retail section consists of 30.991 acres in Parcel C and 39.079 acres in Parcel D.

the district along roads constructed within the district. This development has been zoned RS and approved
for 535 residential units:

       As of December 31, 2013, the developer reports that the final plat for Sections V, VI and VII of the
development was recorded to include 135 lots on 26 acres of the residential portion of the development. At

within Section VII have also been sold to Ryan Homes.      According to Ryan Homes, 97 homes in Section V,

    Hanover County had restricted the number of building permit applications for single-family units
within the development to no more than 25 percent of the total number of single-family residential units
approved (449) in any twelve month period (which equates to a maximum of 122 units per year). If less than
the allowed number of building permits has been issued in a twelve-month period, during the next succeeding
twelve month period, the developer may seek approval for an additional 10 building permits beyond that
number by which the permitted number of building permits exceeds the number of building permits actually
issued. The issuance of building permits for the age-restricted housing units was not subject to this limitation.
As of December 31, 2013, the Hanover County department of Planning reports that the building permit
restriction remains in place.

A.  ANNUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT

       The information provided in this section is taken from the annual special assessment report for the
Bell Creek Community Development Authority dated February 18, 2013. The information herein reflects
information available as of the same date and may not contain the most updated information regarding
special assessment collections, delinquencies or other updates to the expected debt service on the Series 2003
Bonds as of the date of this annual continuing disclosure report.

       An annual installment of special assessments is to be collected from each parcel of taxable property
within the CDA (except those for which the assessment lien has been prepaid) each year in an amount equal
to the "Annual Revenue Requirement." The annual revenue requirement, generally, is equal to: (i) annual debt
service and administrative expenses, less (ii) available investment income and surplus funds from prior year.

       Annual installments to be collected in 2013 will be due on June 5 and October 5, 2013. The special
assessments due on June 5, 2013 will be available to pay debt service on the bonds on September 1, 2013 and
the special assessments due on October 5, 2013 will be available to pay debt service on the bonds on March
1, 2014. Accordingly, the payments on the bonds to be covered by the special assessments to be collected in
2013 are the payments due on September 1, 2013, and March 1, 2014.

       The    annual  revenue    requirement  is  to  be  calculated  for  both  Series  A   and  B  Bonds.    Annual
installments in the amount of $300,000 for the Series 2003 Bonds need to be collected in 2013 in order to
meet the annual revenue requirement. The balance of this report explains the methodology for determining
the annual revenue requirement.

       Table V-1 below provides a summary of the annual revenue requirement for 2013.

        Series 2003A Bonds in the amount of $10,913,000 have been redeemed as of September 1, 2012 with
special assessment prepayments, reserve fund credits and sinking fund payments.       Additional Series 2003A
Bonds in the amount of $334,000 are scheduled to be redeemed with special assessment prepayments and
sinking fund payments on March 1, 2013.    As a result, the outstanding principal balance on Series 2003A
Bonds is equal to $888,000 ($12,135,000 - $10,913,000 - $334,000 = $888,000) as shown in Table V-2
below.

        Series 2003B Bonds in the amount of $2,225,000 have been redeemed as of September 1, 2012 with

Bonds in the amount of $87,000 are scheduled to be redeemed with special assessment prepayments and

1, 2013.

          Following the optional redemption of bonds on March 1, 2012, the trustee performed a valuation of
the reserve fund and the current reserve fund requirement is $284,200.    As a result, there are excess funds in
the Reserve Fund in the amount of $47,500 ($331,700 - $284,200 = $47,500).           The trust indenture provides
for excess Reserve Fund proceeds to be transferred to the bond fund.      Once transferred, these funds will be
used to redeemed bonds on March 1, 2013 pursuant to the terms of the trust indenture.              At the current
investment rate of 4.46%, the reserve requirement of $284,200 will result in annual investment income of
$12,675.32, which will be available to pay debt service in 2013 and 2014

Surplus from Prior Year

Table V-4 below outlines the surplus from the prior year that will be made available to pay debt service and
administrative expenses for fiscal year 2013.         The annual revenue requirement for fiscal year 2012 was
$340,000.     Annual installments were due on June 5th and October 5th of 2012.      As of February 26, 2013,
special assessments in the amount of $336,979.83 for the fiscal year 2012 have been collected and transferred
to the trustee by Hanover County.       Special assessments in the aggregate amount of $3,020.13 remain to be
collected. The county is still pursuing the collection of these delinquent special assessments.

          As  of  February  26,  2013,  the  balance  in  the  Revenue    Fund  was  $301,883.25.  Reserve Fund
investment income in the amount of $7,598.70 will be available on March 1, 2013.     A portion of these funds
and the aggregate interest income earned through March 1, 2013 will be transferred to the Interest Account
and Principal Account to pay debt service, which includes interest payment of $97,942.50 and a principal
payment of $130,000 that are due on March 1, 2013.

          The administrative budget for fiscal year 2012 was $42,875.00.        This budget was to be funded with
annual installments collected in 2012. The Administrative Expenses Fund was funded with the 2012 first-half
annual installments in the amount of $17,860.99 on September 1, 2012.           As a result, second-half annual
installments in the amount of $25,014.01 ($42,875.00 - $17,860.99 = $25,014.01) will be transferred to the
Administrative Expenses Fund to pay the balance of fiscal year 2012 expenses.        An additional $32,000 in
surplus revenues will be retained in the Revenue Fund to be applied as credit against the annual revenue
requirement in the future.      Accordingly, surplus funds from prior year that will be made available to pay debt
service and administrative expenses for the fiscal year 2013 is equal to $25,525.44 as shown in Table V-4 in
the following page.

As more fully described in the listed event notice dated as of January 13, 2015, The Supreme Court of the

Commonwealth      of  Virginia  has  reversed    a  decision  rendered  by     the  Circuit  Court  of  the  City  of

Fredericksburg concluding that the City had not demonstrated that it has strictly complied with Code

Sections 15.2-5158 (A)(5) or 58.1-3965.2 allowing the City to bring suit to collect delinquent special

assessments through a tax foreclosure proceeding. The Court ruled that Code Section 15.2-5158(A)(5)

providing for a levy of special assessments does not, in and of itself, provide for a tax foreclosure

proceeding to collect delinquent special assessments even though the special assessment constitutes a lien

on the property. As of January 9, 2015, Taxing Authority Consulting Services reported that they would

analyze the opinion and assess the options available to the City.

As of December 31, 2014, the total amount of Series 2006 Bonds outstanding was $23,882,000.00.

       According        to  the  Limited  Offering  Memorandum,       an       approximately  16-acre  pedestrian  friendly

entertainment district was proposed within the development. The entertainment district was expected to include a

variety of live music entertainment venues, concert stages, themed restaurants, and retail stores in a unique outdoor

setting. As a part of the entertainment district, the Landowner was expected to construct an aerial gondola cable

system that was anticipated to transport visitors across Rappahannock River to historical attractions in Stafford

County, Virginia. As of February 24, 2014, the Developer reports that construction of the gondola system is

pending and will proceed when a viable tourism project is built.

Residential Development

       According to the Limited Offering Memorandum, the zoning ordinance governing the development

allows ten percent of the land area within the development to be used for the residential development subject to

obtaining a discretionary conditional permit from the City of Fredericksburg. The Landowner plans to construct

up to 750 active adult condominiums on 54 acres of the retail development.

       According to the memorandum from the Developer to the bondholders, dated December 29, 2009, the

Landowner had entered into an agreement to sell 13.4 acres of land to a well established Developer of apartment

communities based in South Carolina on December 4, 2009. The Developer reports that in addition to a twelve-

day inspection period, the sale requires approval of a special use permit from the City of Fredericksburg to allow

construction of the apartment units. According to the Developer, the special use permit was granted on April 11,

2010.

       As  of  September   30,  2014,  the     Developer  reports  that  they  are  assessing  the  market  demand       for

commercial and active adult residential units before proceeding with application for a conditional use permit.

(i)    Status of Sales of Undeveloped Property

       The Developer previously reported that the State of Virginia anticipated issuing a $30,000,000 Recovery

Zone Facility (RZF) Bond to finance the Water Park Hotel and Resort Project, which was expected to go to the

market in the fall of 2010. The Developer previously reported that the $30,000,000 Recovery Zone Facility (RZF)

Bond was expected to be issued by the State of Virginia and was authorized but not issued due to the lack of

construction financing for the Kalahari Resort Project. As a result, the bond allocation was returned to the state.

       The Developer previously reported that a sales contract for a retail multi-use center for approximately five

acres of land was put on hold due to current market conditions. The Developer reported in the quarterly

continuing disclosure statement for the period ending September 30, 2011 that the contract for the retail multi-use

center has expired.

       As of September 30, 2014, the Developer reports that there is no anticipated construction on undeveloped

property.

E.    STATUS OF FINANCING

      According to the Limited Offering Memorandum, approximately $1,500,000 was needed to complete the

infrastructure required by the development plan in addition to the Series 2006 Bond proceeds. The additional

proceeds were required for the completion of the Carl D. Silver Parkway loop through the property owned by the

National Slavery Museum. The cost of this connection was expected to be incurred by the National Slavery

Museum.  According       to   the  Limited  Offering  Memorandum,     if  the  museum   fails  to  meet   the  obligation  to

construct the Carl D. Silver Parkway loop, the Developer was expected to complete the work at its own expense.

      According to the Limited Offering Memorandum, Provident Bank provided a development loan to the

Landowner for the construction of, among other things, the Project. The loan was secured by a first deed of trust

on approximately 108 acres in the development. The maximum loan amount was $17,444,474. In addition, the

Developer previously reported that a $2,500,000 line of credit was obtained from Provident Bank on December

31, 2007 for the purpose of grading and developing certain pad sites. The Developer also reported that a

$4,000,000 construction loan was obtained from Provident Bank on November 14, 2007, for the purpose of

grading a 55-acre site.

      The Developer previously reported that the Provident Bank development loan, the Provident Bank line of

credit, and the Provident Bank construction loan were consolidated into a single loan with M&T Bank in the

amount of $4,400,000. As of February 24, 2014, the Developer reported that the outstanding balance on the M&T

Bank loan was $2,686,599.

Amount to offset Future Debt Service

      The Annual Installment of Assessments for the bond years 2013 through 2037 are anticipated to be

collected in equal annual amounts of $1,951,836.14 for the remaining life of the bonds, resulting in aggregate

Special Assessments of $59,422,302.85, which is equal to the aggregate Special Assessment approved by the CDA

Board in the original Assessment Roll on September 12, 2005. The unutilized portion of the surplus to be collected

in the 2015 tax year in the amount of $20,100.40 will be carried forward to offset deficit collections in later years.

Reserve Fund Investment Income

      As   of  January     31,  2014,   the     Reserve  Fund     balance  was   zero.  The  reserve   requirement  is    equal  to

$1,913,375.00. The balance in the Reserve Fund is zero due to unscheduled draws on the Reserve Fund for the

payment of debt service in 2009, 2010 and 2011. As a result of the nonpayment of annual assessments and the

requirements of the Agreement, investment income is not expected to be earned on any amounts to be transferred

to the Reserve Fund in 2014 or 2015.

Supplemental Reserve Fund

      A Supplemental Reserve Fund was created pursuant to a Supplemental Memorandum of Understanding

(the  "Agreement")       made   as  of  August  30,   2011,   by     and  among  the    Trustee,  the  Celebrate  Virginia  South

Community      Development      Authority       (the  "Authority"),   Celebrate  Virginia  Development     Company,     Inc.    (the

"Developer"),  and       Celebrate    Virginia  South,   LLC   (the   "Landowner").     A    portion   of  the  proceeds    in   the

Construction Fund equal to $1,517,887.17 was transferred to the Supplemental Reserve Fund to be used as an

additional reserve fund to fund the deficiency in the Reserve Fund and the Bonds Payments Account to make the

September 1, 2011 debt service payment as well as to be used on a going forward basis to pay debt service on the

bonds to the extent insufficient funds are in the Reserve Fund and the Bond Payments Account. The funds in the

Supplemental Reserve Fund may be used to pay the costs and expenses of the Authority, the Trustee or the

Bondholders to pursue remedies for defaults under the Bond Documents as defined in the Trust Indenture.

      As of January 31, 2014, the balance in the Supplemental Reserve Fund was $757,169.47. The proceeds in

the Supplemental Reserve Fund are invested in First American Treasury Obligation money market fund currently

earning zero percent. As a result of the nonpayment of assessments due in the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and

2014 tax years, any investment income earned on the Supplemental Reserve Fund through September 1, 2015 will

be used to meet the semi-annual debt service payments due on March 1, 2014 and September 1, 2014, pay

administrative expenses in 2014, or replenish the Reserve Fund up to the reserve requirement.

Deficit from Prior Year

      The deficit from the prior year is shown in Table V-3. Semi-annual interest payments are due on the Series

Landowners agreed to pay $85,000.00 for the payment of extraordinary administrative expenses incurred due to

the nonpayment of annual assessments in 2009 and 2010. The Landowners are to be repaid pro rata as the

outstanding annual assessments are paid. In a Supplemental Memorandum of Understanding, made as of August

30, 2011, the Developer made an additional loan of $102,857.00 to cover its estimated share of Administrative

Expenses through June 30, 2012. To date, the pro rata reimbursement to the Landowners is $44,393.60. As of the

for the purposes of calculating the deficit from the prior year.

       As mentioned above, as of January 31, 2014, the Reserve Fund balance was zero. The reserve requirement

is equal to $1,913,375.00. As a result, an amount equal to $1,913.375.00 will be required to replenish the Reserve

1, 2014 debt service payment.

       Summing the annual expenses and available funds results in a deficit from the prior year of $2,824,580.29.

The deficit from the prior year is provided for information purposes only and is not included in the calculation of

the Annual Revenue Requirement.

Summary

       The expenses of the CDA for the 2015 tax year are equal to $1,951,836.14. The available funds to pay the

expenses    are  estimated    to  be   zero.  As  a  result,  the  annual  revenue  requirement      for  the  2015  tax  year  is

$1,951,836.14.

C.  COLLECTION EFFORTS

    According to the City of Fredericksburg and pursuant to Sections 58.1-3965 and 58.1-3010 of the Virginia

Tax Code, the property becomes eligible for tax sale after the second anniversary of the City's fiscal year (June 30th)

of the oldest tax due date. Accordingly, the delinquent first half assessments for the 2009 tax year, which were due

on September 1, 2009, met the second anniversary of delinquency requirement on September 1, 2011.

    According to the City of Fredericksburg, as of December 21, 2012 a Notice of Delinquent Taxes and

Judicial Sale of Real Property was published in a daily newspaper for seven parcels owned by Celebrate Virginia

South, LLC (Parcels 312-A-P6, 312-A-P6B, 312-A-P7, 312-2-P1F, 312-2-P5C, 312-A-5030, and 312-A-2C), one

parcel owned by CVAS 2, LLC (Parcel 312-A-P8), and five parcels owned by CVAS Parkway, LLC (Parcels 312-A-

P10, 312-A-P4A, 312-A-P11, 312-A-6001, and 312-A-P12).    The  delinquent  annual  assessments       and  related

interest and penalties by tax year and parcel are shown as Appendix 1 to this report. According to the City, the tax

sale process takes approximately one year. As a result, any delinquent annual assessments collected through the tax

sale may not be available to the CDA until mid-2014.

    As of December 17, 2013, Taxing Authority Consulting Services indicated that the Court had granted a

Decree of Sale for tax map parcel 312-A-P8, which is the largest parcel in the CDA upon which the greatest annual

assessments have been levied. Inquiries have been made with Taxing Authority Consulting Services and the City

Treasurer as to when they anticipate the tax sale will take place, but as the date of this report, no date has been set.

    As more fully described in the listed event notice dated as of January 13, 2015, The Supreme Court of the

Commonwealth of Virginia has reversed a decision rendered by the Circuit Court of the City of Fredericksburg

concluding that the City had not demonstrated that it has strictly complied with Code Sections 15.2-5158 (A)(5) or

58.1-3965.2 allowing the City to bring suit to collect delinquent special assessments through a tax foreclosure

proceeding. The Court ruled that Code Section 15.2-5158(A)(5) providing for a levy of special assessments does

not, in and of itself, provide for a tax foreclosure proceeding to collect delinquent special assessments even though

the special assessment constitutes a lien on the property. As of January 9, 2015, Taxing Authority Consulting

Services reported that they would analyze the opinion and assess the options available to the City.

reversal of the decision rendered by the Circuit Court of the City of Fredericksburg. As more fully described in the

notice, The Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Virginia has reversed a decision rendered by the Circuit

Court of the City of Fredericksburg concluding that the City had not demonstrated that it has strictly complied

with Code Sections 15.2-5158 (A)(5) or 58.1-3965.2 allowing the City to bring suit to collect delinquent special

assessments through a tax foreclosure proceeding. The Court ruled that Code Section 15.2-5158(A)(5) providing

for a levy of special assessments does not, in and of itself, provide for a tax foreclosure proceeding to collect

delinquent special assessments even though the special assessment constitutes a lien on the property. Details of

this filing are available on the MSRB-EMMA website. As of January 9, 2015, Taxing Authority Consulting Services

reported that they would analyze the opinion and assess the options available to the City.
